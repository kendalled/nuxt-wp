      <p>Disney pin collecting has become one of the most beloved hobbies for Disney enthusiasts worldwide. What started as simple souvenirs has evolved into a complex collecting culture with rare pins selling for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.</p>

      <h2>The Early Days (1960s-1980s)</h2>

      <p>Disney pins began as simple promotional items in the 1960s. The earliest Disney pins were basic designs featuring Mickey Mouse and other classic characters. These weren't meant for collecting - they were simply souvenirs guests could purchase to remember their visit to Disneyland.</p>

      <p>During this period, pins were often made with basic materials and simple designs. The focus was on affordability rather than collectibility, and most pins featured the iconic Disney characters in straightforward poses.</p>

      <h2>The Birth of Pin Trading (1999)</h2>

      <p>Everything changed in 1999 when Disney officially launched Disney Pin Trading at Walt Disney World Resort. This initiative transformed casual souvenir pins into a structured collecting hobby with rules, etiquette, and official Disney Cast Member participation.</p>

      <p>The program introduced:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Official Disney Pin Trading rules</li>
        <li>Special lanyard displays for pins</li>
        <li>Cast Member participation in trading</li>
        <li>Limited edition releases</li>
        <li>Special events and pin releases</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Golden Age (2000s-2010s)</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Limited Edition Pins</strong>: Numbered releases that created scarcity and demand</li>
        <li><strong>Hidden Mickey Pins</strong>: Special pins that could only be obtained through trading with Cast Members</li>

        <li><strong>Special Techniques</strong>: Pins featuring glitter, glow-in-the-dark elements, and moveable parts</li>
      </ul>

      <p>During this period, pins became investment-quality collectibles, with some rare pins appreciating significantly in value.</p>

      <h2>Modern Pin Trading (2020s)</h2>

      <p>Today's Disney pin scene is more vibrant than ever, despite challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic. Modern developments include:</p>
