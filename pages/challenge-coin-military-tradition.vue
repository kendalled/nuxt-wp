      <p>Challenge coins represent one of the most enduring and meaningful traditions in military culture. These small, commemorative medallions carry profound significance that extends far beyond their physical form, embodying honor, brotherhood, and shared sacrifice.</p>

      <h2>Origins: From Ancient Rome to Modern Military</h2>

      <h3>Ancient Precedents</h3>
      <p>The concept of military medallions dates back to ancient Rome, where soldiers received coins as rewards for exceptional service. These early coins bore the likeness of emperors and were symbols of imperial favor and military achievement.</p>

      <h3>World War I: The Birth of Modern Challenge Coins</h3>
      <p>The most widely accepted origin story of modern challenge coins traces back to World War I. A wealthy American lieutenant ordered bronze medallions for his flying squadron, each bearing the unit's insignia. When one young pilot was shot down and captured behind enemy lines, this medallion became his salvation.</p>

      <h2>The Challenge Coin Tradition</h2>

      <h3>The Challenge Ritual</h3>
      <p>The formal challenge coin tradition involves specific protocols:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Challenge</strong>: A coin holder initiates a challenge by displaying their coin</li>
        <li><strong>The Response</strong>: Others must produce their own unit coins within one minute</li>
        <li><strong>The Penalty</strong>: Those without coins must buy drinks for the challengers</li>
        <li><strong>The Reward</strong>: If everyone has their coin, the challenger buys the round</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Rules of Engagement</h3>
      <p>Traditional challenge coin etiquette includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Coins must be carried at all times</li>
        <li>A dropped coin during a challenge means you buy the drinks</li>
        <li>Challenges can happen anywhere, anytime</li>
        <li>The most senior person present can end a challenge</li>
        <li>Coins should never be given as gifts - they must be earned</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The challenge coin tradition stands as a testament to the enduring power of symbols to unite, inspire, and honor those who answer the call to serve.</p>
