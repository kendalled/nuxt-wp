pciHeadline: Why Choose Antique Silver Plating?
pciPara1: Antique silver plating is perfect for a rustic feel to your coin. This plating provides contrast between raised and recessed areas that will make any text on your coin easier to read. This plating is available at a small up-charge, just ask us and we can provide pricing options!
pciPara2: Antique platings are our recommended choice for no color designs. With the added contrast, your design is sure to stand out. All metal areas are dulled in the plating process when you choose antique gold, so your coin will have less noticeable scratches and dents as time goes on. Antique gold plating is a great choice for a classy but durable coin.
