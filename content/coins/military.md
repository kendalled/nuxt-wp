pciHeadline: What is a Military Challenge Coin? 
pciPara1: The use of coins to reward soldiers dates back to the roman empire, when soldiers were given a coin to recognize their achievements. These medals played a prominent role in World War I and II, being used to identify soldiers in case of emergency. The challenge coin gave the soldiers a way to show their loyalty to someone who could help in case they were captured by the enemy.
pciPara2: They also began the tradition of the “coin check,” where you ask to see another soldier’s coin. If they don’t have it, the drinks are on them that night!
