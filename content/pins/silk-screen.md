pciHeadline: What is a silk screen pin?
pciPara1: Silk Screen pins make your design stand out with no metal separation. Silk screen lapel pins are similar to silk screened t-shirts. A base coat is laid over the pins, then layered one by one through a screen with the help of a roller. After each color has been applied, a protective coating seals the design and protects it from fading or scratches.
pciPara2: Once you have authorized your artwork, we immediately put your order into production.
