pciHeadline: What is an Offset Printed pin?
pciPara1: Offset Printed pins are perfect for complex designs. They allow you to perfectly recreate highly detailed or multicolored designs. Offset printed pins use a special printing technique using a digital file or photographic negative. This allows you to make designs that require gradients, shadows, and other subtle color changes.
pciPara2: You can even have your pick of any font, colors, and other design elements. Offset printed pins allow you to bring any idea to life without the limits that enamel pins generally have!
