pciHeadline: What is a Hard Enamel pin?
pciPara1: Hard Enamel pins offer a classy look with fast production time. This style of custom lapel pin is made with raised and recessed metal areas. Also known as cloisonné pins, hard enamel lapel pins are true jewelry grade products and are often considered collectibles. They are unmatched in quality.
pciPara2: The art of cloisonné uses "frit," glass crushed to a powder and mixed with water to create a paste, to fill the recessed areas in your design. The frit is added to the design, similar to a paint by number process. The pins are then baked to melt the frit, which flows smoothly and fills all the empty space. Baking the pin at these temperatures hardens the frit and this is where the term "hard enamel" comes from. These pins are polished, classy, and perfect for a variety of uses.
