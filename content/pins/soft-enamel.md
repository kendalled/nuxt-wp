para1: When making soft enamel pins, a die is made first to stamp your design onto the metal base. After your pin has been stamped and cut, the plating process starts. Using either gold, silver, nickel, or black chrome, your design is beautifully plated and finished.
para2: Once plating is complete, the raised metal surfaces are polished to a mirror-like finish and the recessed areas are filled with colorful enamel paint. This enamel contrasts beautifully with the polished raised metal, resulting in a classic soft enamel lapel pin.

headline3: What production method should I choose?
para3: Most custom pin designs can be made into soft enamel pins, but this process often works best with designs that have minimal lines and clearly defined areas of color. These details are important because the colored areas sit slightly recessed, below the metal separations. If you’re not sure which type of pin to choose, don’t worry! Just ask, and we can provide suggestions from our experienced team.

pciHeadline: Why choose a soft enamel pin?
pciPara1: Custom pins are small, customizable, and easy to make. You can design them to be as classy as you need them to be, and they make for the perfect subtle fashion statement. Showing pride in your achievements or support for a certain cause or movement is easier than ever with lapel pins. They may be small, but custom pins can be huge for your fundraiser.
pciPara2: Pins are the perfect conversation starters. An attendee of your fundraiser would always have a story to tell about it, whether it’s how and why they got the pin or what your organization stands for. It’s a perfect way to get your brand out there and people talking about it. When it comes to selling them, pins are a perfect opportunity for a passerby to donate money to a good cause and walk away with something to show for it!
