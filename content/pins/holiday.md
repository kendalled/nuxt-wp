headline3: What production method should I choose?
para3: Most custom pin designs can be made into soft enamel pins, but this process often works best with designs that have minimal lines and clearly defined areas of color. These details are important because the colored areas sit slightly recessed, below the metal separations. If you’re not sure which type of pin to choose, don’t worry! Just ask, and we can provide suggestions from our experienced team.

pciHeadline: Why Choose Custom Holiday Pins?
pciPara1: The Holidays are a wonderful time to enjoy with your friends, family, and others in your life. They can be a time to come together and share with others, and a comforting time in many people’s lives. No matter what you celebrate or who you celebrate it with, it is a time for sharing, unity, and love. Pins can make a great and inexpensive present for all your loved ones. They are easily customizable and can be a meaningful and timeless keepsake for everyone in your life.
pciPara2: There are countless smaller holidays every day of the year as well. Days like national pencil day, or month long celebrations like literacy month, while not well-known, can be a good excuse to motivate people. For example, literacy month can be used by teachers to encourage their students to read more often. Pins can be used as awards as well as gifts, and further inspire these students.
