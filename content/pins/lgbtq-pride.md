headline3: What production method should I choose?
para3: Most custom pin designs can be made into soft enamel pins, but this process often works best with designs that have minimal lines and clearly defined areas of color. These details are important because the colored areas sit slightly recessed, below the metal separations. If you’re not sure which type of pin to choose, don’t worry! Just ask, and we can provide suggestions from our experienced team.

pciHeadline: The History of the Rainbow Flag
pciPara1: Since 1978, the rainbow has been a meaningful symbol for the lgbt community. It holds a deep significance for members of this community. The flag was designed with the colors of the rainbow with a purpose, each one representing a different core value of the equality movement.
pciPara2: When the flag was designed, each color was assigned a value. Red stands for life. Orange represents healing, especially meaningful to a community that has lost so many. Yellow and Green represent sunlight and nature respectively. Blue is for harmony, and Violet is for spirit. Each of these values is essential to the lgbt community and represents everything they stand for.
