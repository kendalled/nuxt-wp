## Testing Strategy

For each item above:
1. ‚úÖ **Check the box** when implementing the feature
2. üöÄ **Deploy immediately** to Netlify after each change  
3. ‚úÖ **Verify deployment succeeds** before moving to next item
4. üîÑ **If deployment fails**, revert that specific change and note the issue
5. üìù **Document any problematic changes** for later investigation

## Deployment Commands

After each change:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add [feature name]"
git push origin main
```

Check Netlify deployment status before proceeding to next item.

## Rollback Strategy

If any feature breaks deployment:
```bash
git revert HEAD  # Revert the problematic commit
git push origin main  # Deploy the revert
```

Then investigate the specific issue before attempting to re-add that feature.

## Notes

- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT upgrade Nuxt version - keep at working version
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT add Nitro netlify preset to `nuxt.config.ts` 
- Start with simpler features first (content, basic components)
- Save complex features (blog system) for last
- Each deployment should be small and isolated

## Current Status
